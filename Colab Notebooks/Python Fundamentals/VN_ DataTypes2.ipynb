This type of variable is hugely valuable in holding onto the state of things.  For example, a boolean variable called loggedIn might hold True if the user is loggedIn and False otherwise.  This means that at any point while a program is running, it is possible to ask the question \"Is the user logged in?\".  The answer will depend on the value of the variable loggedIn.  \n","\n","Although we will use the values True and False as words, Python stores them as 1 for true and 0 for false.   \n","\n","To demonstrate this, write a function called **show_trueFalse()** which will:  \n","\n","*  create a variable called **logged_in** and assign it the value True (use the *  assignment operator = the same as usual)  \n","*  create a variable called **logged_in_as_num** and assign it the value int(True)  \n","*  print `logged_in` and `logged_in_as_num`\n","\n","Expected output:  \n","True 1\n","\n","When you have run this, change True to False in both places.\n","\n","Expected output:  \n","False 0\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"XNHcNQEKW8xj","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1642422313175,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":373,"user":{"displayName":"Valentina Nacar","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"03922103004082663720"}},"outputId":"a58191d3-9360-4f17-b65e-a479348f5096"},"source":["def show_trueFalse():\n","  logged_in= False\n","  logged_in_as_num= int(logged_in)\n","  print(logged_in,logged_in_as_num)\n","\n","show_trueFalse()"],"execution_count":17,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["False 0\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r8O47uBPW9Gy"},"source":["---\n","### Exercise 3 -
