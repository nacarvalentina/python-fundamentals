The function will shift the letters in the message according to the key and the direction (encrypt or decrypt)\n","\n","For example: the message is \"Hello World\" and the cipher is 3. Each letter is changed to the letter that is 3 places in front in the alphabet. So \"H\" will become \"K\", \"e\" will become \"h\", \"l\" will become \"o\", \"o\" will become \"r\", \"W\" will become \"Z\", \"r\" will become \"u\" and \"d\" will become \"g\". A space will become \"#\"\n","\n","The encrypted message is: \"Khoor Zruog\"\n","\n","Here is a second set of test data:\n","Message: \"This is encrypted text\"\n","Cipher: 5\n","Expected encrypted message: \"Ymnx nx jshwduyji yjcy\"\n","\n","(You will need to think carefully about how to apply the cipher when it would take it past \"z\". It will need to wrap around to continue shifting from \"a\". You will also need to cater for spaces - these should not be changed).\n","\n","Use the code cell below to create your program and functions."],"metadata":{"id":"VuHep6pjD43Z"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9EnEsjVDDr7j"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}]}
